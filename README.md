# TYPO3 Extension `remove_yoast_comment`

This extension removes the comment that Yoast SEO adds to the `<head>` section of your TYPO3 site.

Even though Open-Source is great, there is no need to add this hardcoded comment to every page.

### Installation

```console
composer require studiomitte/remove-yoast-comment
```
